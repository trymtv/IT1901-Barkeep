This repo contains the code for our project in IT1901 fall 2020.

BarKeep is an application to keep track of those guys who owes you a beer,
but never seem to buy you one.\
In addition to keeping track of beers owed to you, it also supports *pinging*
your disloyal friends.

The sourcecode can be found under
`/BarKeep/src` ([Here](https://gitlab.stud.idi.ntnu.no/it1901/groups-2020/gr2011/gr2011/-/tree/master/BarKeep%2Fsrc))
